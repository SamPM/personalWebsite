                <h3>Personal Website</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I built my personal website to improve my understanding of basic web development and to build experience using html and css. After researching other examples of personal websites, I decided what content I wanted to include: a home page introducing users to the website, an online version of my CV and a projects page that would detail information about recent projects I had completed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I designed my website to be simple, easy to read and consistent. Using a bootstrap framework, I took advantage of its grid system to organise the layout of each page. I used Sublime Text to write my html and css files for the website. I used GitHub pages to host my website.</p>

                <h3>Newcastle University Lacrosse Website</h3>
                <br>
                <a href="http://newcastleunilax.com/">Newcastle University Mens Lacrosse Club Website</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I updated and redesigned Newcastle University Mens Lacrosse Club's wordpress website using a customizable premade wordpress theme. Using wordpress was a new experience for me and was something that I had to learn. After becoming familiar with the wordpress interface I experimented with a few different themes. I chose to use the free version of a theme called <a href="https://athemes.com/theme/sydney/">Sydney made by aThemes</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The theme I used provided a range of customizable options, one of which made customizing the home page's main header very easy. However, there was a lot more required to do to produce the design that I wanted. I used recommended plugins and tools to create and organise the layout of each page. I took advantage of other Sydney theme features to use on certain pages. I also had to edit parts of the css to produce the colour schemes that I wanted and to make other alterations.</p>

                <h3>Newcastle University Lacrosse Leaflets</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I was asked to design and create leaflets to advertise Newcastle University Men's Lacrosse Club to potential new players during freshers week. I designed the leaflet using Adobe Illustrator. Creating leaflets and using Adobe Illustrator were both new experiences for me and with a short deadline to create the leaflets by I had to quickly learn how to effectively use Adobe Illustrator. My aims for the design of the leaflet were to make it visually appealing and to make it stand out. My aims for the content of the leaflet were to persuade new students to try out the sport and to provide clear information about the sport.</p>
