                <h3>IOS Flip Coin Application</h3>
                <br>
                <p>During my Easter break I decided to learn how to develop IOS applications using Xcode and the Swift programming language. After learning the Swift syntax and how to use Xcode, I developed a basic coin flip application that allows a user to press a button that will then reveal either heads or tails. The application has two screens: a main screen where the user ‘flips’ for either heads or tails, and a settings screen that allows a user to alter the probability of either heads or tails.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What I gained from building this application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experience using Xcode and writing code in Swift</li>
                    <li>Increased understanding of the MVC architecture</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of how to pass information between different view controllers</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of how to create a dynamic layout that adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>In the future I will be creating more complex applications to increase my understanding of IOS development.</p>

                <h3>Personal Website</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I built my personal website to improve my understanding of basic web development and to build experience using html and css. After researching other examples of personal websites, I decided what content I wanted to include: a home page introducing users to the website, an online version of my CV and a projects page that would detail information about recent projects I had completed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I designed my website to be simple, easy to read and consistent. Using a bootstrap framework, I took advantage of its grid system to organise the layout of each page. I used Sublime Text to write my html and css files for the website. I used GitHub pages to host my website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>*Website still needs to be properly optimised for mobile devices</p>

                <h3>Newcastle University Lacrosse Website</h3>
                <br>
                <a href="http://newcastleunilax.com/">Newcastle University Mens Lacrosse Club Website</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I updated and redesigned Newcastle University Mens Lacrosse Club's wordpress website using a customizable premade wordpress theme. Using wordpress was a new experience for me and was something that I had to learn. After becoming familiar with the wordpress interface I experimented with a few different themes. I chose to use the free version of a theme called <a href="https://athemes.com/theme/sydney/">Sydney made by aThemes</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The theme I used provided a range of customizable options, one of which made customizing the home page's main header very easy. However, there was a lot more required to do to produce the design that I wanted. I used recommended plugins and tools to create and organise the layout of each page. I took advantage of other Sydney theme features to use on certain pages. I also had to edit parts of the css to produce the colour schemes that I wanted and to make other alterations.</p>
